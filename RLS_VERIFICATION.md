# Row Level Security (RLS) Verification Report

## ‚úÖ RLS Status: ENABLED

The `public.resumes` table has Row Level Security **ENABLED** and fully configured.

---

## üîí Active RLS Policies

### 1. **Users can view their own resumes**
- **Operation**: SELECT
- **Condition**: `auth.uid() = user_id`
- **Effect**: Users can only query their own resume records

### 2. **Users can insert their own resumes**
- **Operation**: INSERT
- **Condition**: `auth.uid() = user_id`
- **Effect**: Users can only create resumes for themselves

### 3. **Users can update their own resumes**
- **Operation**: UPDATE
- **Condition**: `auth.uid() = user_id` (both USING and WITH CHECK)
- **Effect**: Users can only modify their own resumes

### 4. **Users can delete their own resumes**
- **Operation**: DELETE
- **Condition**: `auth.uid() = user_id`
- **Effect**: Users can only delete their own resumes

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Guarantees

### What RLS Prevents:
- ‚ùå Users **CANNOT** view other users' resumes
- ‚ùå Users **CANNOT** create resumes for other users
- ‚ùå Users **CANNOT** modify other users' resumes
- ‚ùå Users **CANNOT** delete other users' resumes
- ‚ùå Unauthenticated users **CANNOT** access any resume data

### What RLS Allows:
- ‚úÖ Users **CAN** view all their own resumes
- ‚úÖ Users **CAN** create new resumes for themselves
- ‚úÖ Users **CAN** update their own resumes
- ‚úÖ Users **CAN** delete their own resumes

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User A tries to view User B's resume
```sql
-- User A is authenticated with uid = 'user-a-uuid'
SELECT * FROM resumes WHERE id = 'user-b-resume-uuid';
-- Result: 0 rows (blocked by RLS)
```

### Scenario 2: User A views their own resumes
```sql
-- User A is authenticated with uid = 'user-a-uuid'
SELECT * FROM resumes WHERE user_id = 'user-a-uuid';
-- Result: All User A's resumes (allowed by RLS)
```

### Scenario 3: User A tries to create resume for User B
```sql
-- User A is authenticated with uid = 'user-a-uuid'
INSERT INTO resumes (user_id, full_name, email, contact_number)
VALUES ('user-b-uuid', 'Test', 'test@example.com', '123');
-- Result: ERROR - RLS policy violation
```

### Scenario 4: Unauthenticated user tries to access data
```sql
-- No user authenticated (auth.uid() = NULL)
SELECT * FROM resumes;
-- Result: 0 rows (blocked by RLS)
```

---

## üîç How It Works

### Authentication Check
```sql
auth.uid() = user_id
```

- `auth.uid()` - Returns the UUID of the currently authenticated user
- `user_id` - The user_id column in the resumes table
- If they match, access is granted
- If they don't match or user is not authenticated, access is denied

### Policy Application
1. **Every query** to the `resumes` table is automatically filtered by RLS
2. PostgreSQL **automatically adds** the RLS condition to WHERE clauses
3. Users **never see** data they shouldn't access
4. No additional code needed in your application

## üìä Current Configuration

| Aspect | Status | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| RLS Enabled | ‚úÖ YES | Enforced at database level |
| SELECT Policy | ‚úÖ ACTIVE | Users can view own data |
| INSERT Policy | ‚úÖ ACTIVE | Users can create own data |
| UPDATE Policy | ‚úÖ ACTIVE | Users can modify own data |
| DELETE Policy | ‚úÖ ACTIVE | Users can delete own data |
| Policy Type | PERMISSIVE | Allows matching conditions |
| Roles | PUBLIC | Applies to all authenticated users |

## üöÄ Usage in Application

### With Supabase Client (Automatic)
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/client';

// RLS is automatically enforced!
const supabase = createClient();

// This will ONLY return the current user's resumes
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('resumes')
  .select('*');

// This will ONLY update the current user's resume
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('resumes')
  .update({ title: 'New Title' })
  .eq('id', resumeId);
```

### With Service Functions
```typescript
import { getUserResumes } from '@/lib/supabase/resume-service';

// RLS automatically filters to current user's resumes
const resumes = await getUserResumes();
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### 1. Service Role Bypass
The service role key **BYPASSES** RLS. Only use it for:
- Admin operations
- Background jobs
- Migrations

**Never** expose the service role key to the client!

### 2. Anonymous Key Safety
The anonymous (anon) key is safe to expose because:
- RLS policies are enforced
- Users can only access their own data
- Authentication is required for data access

### 3. Testing RLS
To test RLS policies:
```sql
-- Test as specific user
SET request.jwt.claims.sub = 'user-uuid-here';

-- Run your queries
SELECT * FROM resumes;

-- Reset
RESET request.jwt.claims.sub;
```
