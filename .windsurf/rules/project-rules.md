use the supabse mcp to make the changes in the databse whenever is required

use the shadcn and the magicUi mcp to get the ui components so we dont have to rebuild all the componenet again and again

i have added the aceternity ui registry in the components.json so that you can access it easly and import the components from there

use the aceternity components mostly as that will be preferred

check for the parsing errors before completing a task and if found fix it before completing the task

dont make the md file after each task and also dont run the npm run build until told to do it and also no need to run the dev preview server as it will be always running in the terminal background
